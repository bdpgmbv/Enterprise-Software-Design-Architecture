Phase 1: Data Modeling 
* Created a JAXB Maven Project. 
* Using "maven-jaxb2-plugin" - the most advanced and feature-full Maven plugin for XML Schema compilation. This Maven plugin wraps and enhances the JAXB Schema Compiler (XJC) and allows compiling XML Schemas (as well as WSDL, DTDs, RELAX NG) into Java classes in Maven builds.
* Added the Plugin to the pom.xml file.
* Under src/main/resources created a Schema.xsd, Schema.xjb, jaxb.properties, DateAdapter.xsd files.
